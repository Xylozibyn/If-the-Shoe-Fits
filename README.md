Synopsis

Slade Incorporated a modest but successful shoe company release a line of sports shoes called Slade Runners

and secure the endorsement of current superstar athlete Junior Presley.

Jessop Industries release their superior shoes Spring Katz effectively stealing Presleys endorsement.

Levi Slade informs his Executive Advertising Director Anne Harris that if she doesn't find a way to promote Slade Runners and recoup predicted loses

she will be swapping her lucrative position as head of advertising for a career as coffee maker in the buildings cafeteria.

Anne sends Ray Coombes to Lapland to convince ex-olympian athlete and Sami* reindeer herder Borge Oli Olaf

the only person ever to have beaten Presley to return with him to America to film a series of commercials promoting Slade Runners.

Having recently lost his beloved reindeer to a pack of wolves, and therefore with no real reason to stay, Borge accepts Ray's offer and returns with him to America.

Borge discovers that a baby reindeer is among the residents at the local childrens zoo owned by Levi Slade,

but through Levis' daughter he learns that the zoo is not making enough profit to pay the mortgage, and Levi may be forced to close it down.

Levi Slade runs into the condesending Charles Jessop at a charity fundraiser for the childrens zoo, and recklessly places a bet on a race between Presley and Borge

to prove who makes the better footwear.

In the outcome if Borge should win Jessop must pull his shoes off the market and pay the mortgage on the zoo, If Presley wins Slade pulls his shoes off the market

and hands ownership of the childrens zoo over to Jessop, who plans to have it demolished to construct a mall on the site.




Int - Day - Levi Slades Office


Anne Harris, Executive Director of the advertising branch for Slade Incorporated opens the door and approaches Levis' desk.


Anne
I'm sorry to interrupt Mr Slade, but I've just spoken to Horton Billings,  manager for Junior Presley, the athlete.


Levi
I know who he is.


Anne
Well Mr Slade, sir, it seems they've changed their minds about endorsing Slade Runners, and they're switching to Jessops Spring Katz.


Levi
What, how does that happen? no no no no we'll see about that.


Levi Slade hits a designated button on speed dial.


Int - Day - Horton Billings Apartment


Billings is running on a treadmill.


Horton
Lee how are ya, I was just on the phone with your executive director Helen Sara Mary...


Levi
Anne, yeah that's a funny thing...she tells me you're canceling your endorsement for Slade Runners.

Please tell me she's mistaken.


Horton
Look Lee, it's nothing against your runners, I think they're great, in fact I'm wearing the pair you sent me right now. (Horton is actually wearing Spring Katz)

It's just Junior says he feels better, and runs better in Spring Katz, and what's best for Junior is best for me.

Look sorry Lee I gotta run, good luck with your shoes...and thanks for everything.


Levi hangs up and stares angrily at Anne.


Levi
I thought you said our shoes were the best on the market.


Anne
I thought they were sir, market research certified it.


Levi
well clearly I'm paying them too much.

Haven't we got a million of those things on the dock?

Now we'd be lucky to give them away, damn you Jessop, god I even hate saying his name.

I can't believe I let you talk me into making sports shoes, I must have been drunk.

Well I can't be wasting my time figuring this out, that's what I pay you for.

What kind of name is that anyway, Junior, what is he an infant?

Well what are standing there for?

Get back to your office and start cracking that whip of yours, and don't say what whip...I've seen it.

and you better hope your creative geniuses can think of something, or you'll be making tea in the cafeteria.

Don't come back until you've got some good news.




Int - Day - Slade Inc - Advertising Branch


Ray
Come on, why not give me another chance?


Anne
You had your chance, but you blew it when you neglected to mention your wife.


Ray
Hey, here's something.


Anne
Whadda ya got?


Ray
Borge.


Anne
Sounds gross, you can keep it.


Ray
During the 1988 Seoul olympics, Norwegian entry Borge Oli Olaf outclassed Junior Presley to snatch gold in the 100 metre sprint.

However, due to controversy over a positive drug test, he was stripped of his medal, and they gave it to Presley.


Anne
So he's a Viking roid junky, next.


Ray
No it was pot.


Anne
Oh...great.


Ray
No no wait, I think we might have something here. Marijuana's hardly a performance drug.

Besides, he says he doesn't remember smoking anything.


Anne
It's called short term memory loss Ray. (sigh) Ok say we go with...? 


Anne gestures for an answer.


Ray
Borge Oli Olaf.


Anne
How do we explain to Slade that his new poster boy is a pothead.


Ray
We just don't mention it, we cover it up.


Anne
Hmm How do we know if he's even up to it, I mean the guy hasn't had a race in nearly six years, he could be in a bloody wheelchair for all we know.


Ray
The man's a natural athlete, it's like riding a bike.


Anne
Yeah a bike with no wheels. (sigh) Ok I'll make some calls, see what I can do.

I hope you're right about this Coombes, because if the press get wind of this pot scandal, we're both screwed.


Anne exits her office and walks up to Rays' desk.


Anne
Ok go home pack your bags, you're off to Lapland.


Ray
Lapland...what, hang on?


Anne
I've set up a meeting with Brajole, your plane leave tonight.


Ray
Wait a minute, why am I going to Lapland?


Anne
To speak with Broccoli.


Ray
No I mean why do I have to go?


Anne
Well, Walters having anger issues, Trish is pregnant, Bruce is on vacation...and it was your idea.


Ray
Why can't you go?


Anne
I can't go, I've got too much work here to take care of.

Besides, I don't like the cold, I get headaches.


Anne closes her office door.



Ext - Day - Norwegian Forest - Blizzard


Through the blizzard Ray can see the faint glow of a light-bulb, then he hears a distant voice yelling indistinctly.


Borge
Jeg drepe du udyr!*


A loud shotgun blast follows and the tree beside Ray splinters.

Ray is quick to dive in the snow, frightened he lay motionless, paralysed with fear.

He looks up towards the light, and sees a large figure approaching through the blizzard.

He hears footsteps crunching in the snow, they get louder, until a large pair of boots stop in front of him.


Borge
Jeg meget vaer sa god tilgi, jeg tenke du er udyr!


Ray
Please don't kill me.


Borge
English...Ray?


Ray
Yes yes Ray, I'm Ray! Borge?


Borge helps Ray get to his feet.


Borge
Yes yes, Me Borge, Me Borge!

Is you OK? I think you is wolf. (laughs)


Borge opens his arms to embrace Ray, who after having just been shot at by this man, is reluctant, and rears back.


Borge steps forward and gives Ray a bear hug.


Borge
Ah Ray, bror...Komme komme.


Borge picks up Rays backpack, and they both head up to Borges cabin.



Int - Night - Borges' Cabin 


Borge bursts into Rays' room ranting, and to a shocked and bleary Ray appears as a viking.


Borge
The wolf, the wolf, get the gun the wolf is here, come quick it's the wolf we must save the deer.


Ray
Borge Borge it's ok, look look it's ok, no wolves, there are no wolves, you were having a bad dream.


Borge breaks down on Rays bed.


Borge
(sobbing) I miss my reindeer, Dasher, Prancer, and...(sobbing) little Rudolf.



Int - Day - Zoo Chaity Event


Levi
Oh great, Jessops here.


Jessop
Levi old chap, good to see you, and how are you?


Levi
Good Charlie good, how are you?


Jessop
You know I was just saying to Billings here, now that you've lost Presley you're going to need another sporting celebrity to wear your (cough) shoes.


Levi
Well thanks for your concern Charlie but we've already got someone...in fact he's the reason why we had to let Presley go, we just couldn't say no.


Jessop
Oh yes, and who might that be


Levi
Oh big star, big name, huuuge name. anyway can't give too much away now old chap, you know company secrets and all that .

needless to say he could run rings around Presley.


Jessop
Really...well if you're that sure what say we place a little wager on it then shall we?


Levi appears un-nerved.


Jessop
Oh come on man...your man in Slade Runners against Presley in Spring Katz, that should prove who wears the better shoes.


Levi
(gulp) You mean a race?


Jessop
Surely you're not afraid, a moment ago you had all the confidence in the world.


Levi
Oh no no no, (gulp) what did you have in mind?

In the outcome if Borge should win Jessop must pull his shoes off the market and pay the mortgage on the zoo, If Presley wins Slade pulls his shoes off the market

and hands ownership of the childrens zoo over to Jessop, who plans to have it demolished to construct a mall on the site.


Jessop turns to Billings who seems to be distracted.


Jessop
Well come on Billings, let's be off, I've done what I came to do...what is it man? it looks like you've seen a ghost.


Horton
I'm not sure...it's probably nothing.
